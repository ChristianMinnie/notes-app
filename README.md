# notes-app
*** Note that index.js is written in plain JavaScript without any dependencies, while index2.js was built with the jQuery helper library. ***

This is a dynamic application built using both vanilla JS and jQuery that functions as a note taking app. 

I've been meaning to either start a blog, or keep some record that catalogs what I've been learning and what I need to work on. Doing so would allow me to come up with a solution, decide what to prioritize first, make a clear goal, and then plan what I need to do next. To that end, I figured I'd start by making an app that would allow me to do just that. 

The app's features are fully dyanmic - responding to user input and automatically updating the appropriate elements on the page without requiring browser refresh.
